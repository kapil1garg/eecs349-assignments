EECS 349 - Assignment 2
Aaron Karp and Kapil Garg

Input Files:
	Training Data: csv file containing labeled data to train algorithm on
	Meta Data: csv file with header from training data and 
		1 row of values corresponding to type of column (nominal, numeric, binary)
	Validation Data: cvs file containing labeled validation data
	Test data: csv file to test model on (unlabeled)

To test our program, run the pset2.py file. When prompted, enter in the filepaths for the training data, meta data, validation data, and test data. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL FILES HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF COLUMNS AND THEIR ORDER IS THE SAME IN EACH FILE.

Once the algorithm runs, you will be prompted to specify a location to export the classified data csv. Enter a valid file path and it will be exported there.
